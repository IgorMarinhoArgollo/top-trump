# Top Trump Deck Builder Project
This project was inspired on the first project I did while studying the module of Front end Web Development in the Trybe course. The main goal was to practice information transfer through props and practice styling through a figma model.

## My Goals
 * Use Props to send information between components;
 * Follow a figma model (without any indication of font of colors specification) to make the styling;
 * Responsive design;
 * Allow the user to upload images to make cards;
 * Configure printable area;
 * Apply some validations on inputs.
